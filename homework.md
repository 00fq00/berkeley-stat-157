## Assignments

There are weekly assignments. We strongly discourage you from copying solutions
of your fellow students since you're depriving yourself of the experience of
learning how to solve the problems on your own. In particular you won't learn
useful things for the exams and projects this way. Or for that matter, from the
course. If we see brazen plagiarism we will deal with it. That said, you
*should* discuss the problems and solutions with others. You will likely benefit
from that.

Assignments are due on Tuesdays.

* You must hand in the assignments by the end of the lecture, i.e. by
  5pm PST, either in paper or by e-mail to
  [stat-157-2019@gmail.com](mailto://berkeley-stat-157@googlegroups.com). **This
  deadline is firm.**
* Programming assignments are to be submitted as Jupyter Notebooks
  **with their execution traces saved** and with comments in the
  code. This allows the TAs to understand what your code is
  doing. Please be prepared to share the notebooks as code if needed
  (i.e. if we think that you're faking the output we'll ask you to let
  us reproduce the code in the notebook).
* New homeworks will appear at the latest on Tuesdays when the
  previous homework is due, in some cases earlier. The reason for not
  posting all 10 problem sets online is that we need to calibrate how
  quickly we'll cover the material. After all, the homework shouldn't
  rely on material that we haven't covered in class yet.

### Details

As we proceed, we'll be filling in details. In terms of solutions we'll take the liberty to reuse some of your submissions as reference solutions (unless you tell us otherwise).

| Set | Due date  | Problems | Solutions |
|-----|-----------|----------|-----------|
| 1   | 1/29/2019 | | |
| 2   | 2/5/2019  | | |
| 3   | 2/12/2019 | | |

| 10  | 4/30/2019 | | |

### Grading

*The 9 best out of 10 homeworks count*. That is, you can skip one homework or you can simply do them all and we'll only count the 9 best ones. Beyond that, you can be late *once* for *two days*, i.e. you can submit *one* home work on a Thursday by the end of the class. We will make the homeworks available online the day the previous homework is due, possibly earlier (some finetuning is required since we need to ensure that we'll cover the content of the homework in the class). The TAs will return the graded homework within 2 weeks of submission. Overall, homeworks are worth 30% of the overall scores.
